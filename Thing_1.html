					There are a lot of projects I'd like to work on.
					The idea for most of them is to stay under around $100 and end up with a good final project.

							<summary>Physical Music Visualizer</summary>
								<p>
									A physical, wall-mounted music level visualier. This project would take input through a microphone and display volume levels of various frequencies, much like many software visualizers. 
								</p>

							<summary>Dumb Smart Watch</summary>
							<p>
								A smart watch that only serves to show a presence of unread phone notifications, like email and texts, and to control music. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Of course it would also show the time. 
							</p>

							<summary>Open Source Alexa</summary>
								<p>
									Ok so this one is actually really simple. It uses a raspberry pi 3, a mic, and speakers to make what is effectively an Alexa/Amazon Echo alternative that doesn't listen in on you. 
								</p>
								<p>
									My idea was to take the pi with the microphone and plug it into an existing speaker I have with an Aux cable. This simplifies the project nicely and makes the fabrication of some sort of housing to be much easier because it is an attachment not a stand-alone device.

							<summary>Private Messenger Node</summary>
								<p>
									This project builds upon the pirate box idea and make a localized and private chatroom. 
									Implementation of such a device would be as follows:
									<ol>
										<li>
											User 1 goes into a designated area with the pirate box running on battery. The device could be in a backpack or hidden somewhere else.
										</li>
										<li>
											User 1 then discretely sets up the device in the designated area. 
										</li>
										<li>
											Users N enter the area and connect to the device using a key only they have.
										</li>
										<li>
											At this point Users N are privately connected to the box and a chatroom is run off of the machine and displayed on Users N's machines. Chat Logs are only saved on the host machine 
										</li>
									 
									</ol>
								</p>
								<p>	
									The device would be hidden to other devices so no one accidentally gets on the chat room
									Users N connect and join the chat room. The chat would be run and saved locally on the device and therefore secure (unless a user pulls info off of it)
									When the chat is over User 1 can just leave and everyone else connect can just leave. The people never have to meet face to face, just go to a populated area and be on their computers.

							<summary>Home Media Server</summary>
							<p>
									Something that will hold a library of digital movies and music.It should be something that is plugged into a television at all times, but it would be cool if it could stream to other devices through a web browser.
									Needs a DVD/BlueRay player and should be able to record off of discs and save them to the library
									Simple UI to allow users to search and browse their collection.
									Separation between music and movies, should be able to search through these two libraries. 
									Needs to be able to edit metadata of audio and video files.
									Needs software to manage the libraries locally.
