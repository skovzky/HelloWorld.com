# HelloWorld.com

This is a site that I will build from the ground up: very
little copy+paste from other sources. The goal of this is
for me to learn as much as I can about web developement
and having a finished product I can show people. This means
that it will be rough in places and probably terribly
optimized, if at all. But again: the goal here is to learn.

Plans for this is a site that acts as a sort of 
interactive resume for myself. Lists of things I can do
with links to examples I have done.
